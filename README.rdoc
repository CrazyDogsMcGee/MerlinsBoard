Current Progress: Getting validations to work on courses, and creating associated links.

Stream of conciousness:
*Instructors should be able to expel users from the roster
*Assignments
*Right now anyone who creates a new course is automatically assigned as the instructor - Need to have way to add new instructors for TAs and such.

Issues:
*Octal digits in specifying 24-hour time? no leading zeroes...
  *Will probably need model-level validation and conversion.
